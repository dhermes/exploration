# `exploration`

This is a collection of "exploratory" math, science and / or programming
forays I've undertaken (typically in GitHub gists).

I am making this repository because I just have a hard time searching
through my gists (302 in total as of August 8, 2017).

Occasionally, a gist will get "filed" as a potential blog
post ([e.g.][2]).

Sometimes, these gists get "promoted" to full repositories ([e.g.][1]).
